# Google-Sheet-to-Google-Calendar-script
It is a JS code for Gooogle Sheets that is sending calendar made in sheet into Google Calendar app. <br />
It contains UI button that makes it easier for users to launch script. <br />

The main purpose of this project was to upload data from Google Sheets to the Google Calendar application, so my players could easily check our schedule (training plan) on their phones. <br />
I have created UI button so everyone could make changes in our Google Sheet and than after clicking button instantly refreshing data to our Google Calendar. <br />
